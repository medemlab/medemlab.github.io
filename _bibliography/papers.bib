   abstract = {Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy is an orthopedic implant material possessing good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. An international standard suggests a heat treatment known as &ldquo;capability aging&rdquo; for this alloy. This study provides extensive data of mechanical properties under a wide temperature condition built around the capability-aging process. Specifically, it investigates the effect of annealing temperature (573&ndash;973 K) on mechanical properties (i.e., yield strength, tensile strength, hardness, Young&rsquo;s modulus, and mechanical compatibility) of Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloys. Although these mechanical properties showed similar trends with respect to the annealing temperature, Young&rsquo;s modulus exhibited the highest value at 873 K in contrast to those of the other properties shown at 773 K. Such a disparity was discussed in light of static spheroidization and phase decomposition based on microstructural characteristics of the annealed Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloys.},

   abstract = {The importance of deformation twins in static recrystallization kinetics of high-purity alpha titanium was investigated by carrying out thermal annealing tests of deformed materials in combination with electron-backscatterdiffraction- based microstructural analysis. Prior to thermal annealing, the material was compressed to a true strain of 0.22 along three directions to introduce different twinning characteristics. Our results showed that deformation twins substantially promoted the static recrystallization process by deepening the microstructural inhomogeneity induced by the formation of twin boundaries and twinning-induced crystallographic lattice reorientation. Twin morphology was also observed to be important because it influenced the extent of microstructural inhomogeneity. Intersecting twin morphology, caused by the activation of multiple twin variants, was more effective than parallel twin morphology, caused by the activation of a single twin variant (or a twin variant pair), because it gave rise to more twin boundaries, more twin boundary junctions (intersections, triple junctions, etc.), and greater in-grain crystallographic orientation spread.},
