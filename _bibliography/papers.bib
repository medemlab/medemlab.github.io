   abstract = {The low-temperature impact toughness of SA350 LF3 steel is an essential property for casks used to store and transport spent nuclear fuel. This study examined the effects of the double quenching and tempering (QQT) process on the impact toughness of SA350 LF3 steel at 163–183 K, employing a typical quenching and tempering (QT1) process and an extended austenitization (QT2) process for comparison. The microstructure, impact toughness, hardness, and tensile properties of the steel were analyzed to assess the roles of double quenching and extended austenitization in improving low-temperature toughness. Compared to QT1, QT2 marginally reduced the fracture temperature from 178 to 173 K in drop-weight impact tests. On the other hand, the QQT process did not fail at 163 K. The different degrees of improvements in the impact toughness achieved by both methods were interpreted in terms of the grain refinement, grain boundary energy, kernel average misorientation, carbide state, and the other mechanical properties.},

   abstract = {This study has systematically investigated the effect of Y content on the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the Mg–Y–Cu–Ni alloy system. Four alloys, Mg(98−x)YxCu1Ni1 (x = 1, 2, 3, and 4 at.%), were fabricated and compared in various aspects for this purpose. Increasing Y content gave rise to an increasing fraction of long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) phases, and gradually changed their morphology from massive islands to lamellae. The alloying addition also induced an effective grain refinement, while inhibiting the dynamic recrystallization. When the Y content exceeded 3 at.%, a unique phase formed due to a mechanical mixture of the LPSO phase, the peritectic reaction product of Cu, and the eutectic reaction product of Ni. The mechanical properties were explained in light of the LPSO dispersion parameter. The extruded Mg95Y3Cu1Ni1 alloy exhibited excellent mechanical properties combining a yield strength of 381 MPa, tensile strength of 458 MPa, and elongation-to-failure of 6.7%.},

   abstract = {Near-β Ti–3Al–8V–6Cr–4Mo–4Zr alloy necessitates an optimized thermomechanical process to ensure excellent hot workability. The traditional constitutive approach requires a large amount of hot deformation data and has the issue of insubstantially fixed parameters that limit its predictive performance and range of applications. On the other hand, a purely data-driven approach utilizing machine learning (ML) lacks generalizability and physical interpretability, particularly under extrapolated conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes a physics-aided ML framework that combines the Zener–Hollomon equation with a hyperparameter-tuned neural network to dynamically determine material-dependent parameters with respect to the deformation temperature, strain rate, and plastic strain. The proposed framework successfully reduces the predictive error by 44.2 % compared with the conventional Zener–Hollomon constitutive model in the most difficult predictive scenarios, including the lowest temperature and highest strain rate. Moreover, the proposed framework improves not only the predictive accuracy but also the generalizability, both for interpolation and extrapolation, while retaining physical transparency. To validate the predictive applicability, the proposed framework is employed to correct an incomplete processing map that reasonably explains the microstructural evolution under the given processing conditions.},

   pages = {618-628},
   abstract = {The aim of this study was to substitute Y with Gd for Mg–2Ni–2Y alloy and investigate the effect on the alloy’s microstructures and mechanical properties. To achieve this purpose, the following three test alloys were investigated: Mg–2Ni–2Y, Mg–2Ni–1Y–1Gd, and Mg–2Ni–2Gd (at%). These alloys mainly consisted of α-Mg, Mg2Ni, and long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) phases. The Y-to-Gd substitution and the solution treatment minimally altered the phase composition. However, the substitution decreased a volume fraction of the LPSO phase by more than 10%, regardless of the solution treatment. This led to a reduction of mechanical strengths up to 124 MPa. The ability of Gd to form the LPSO phase was weaker than that of Y. However, Gd promoted the dissolution of the LPSO phase in α-Mg matrix during solution treatment. The mechanical properties of the alloy can be explained in terms of the dispersion of the LPSO phase. Increasing the volume fraction of LPSO in the cast alloy resulted in an increase in uniformity of the phase dispersion after subsequent extrusion (0.056 to 0.100 in the degree of dispersion), thereby enhancing the strength of the alloy.},

   abstract = {Mg alloys are extremely valuable in the automotive and aerospace industries because of their lightweight properties and excellent machinability. The applications in these industries necessitate the accurate prediction of fatigue life under cyclic loading. However, this is challenging for many wrought Mg alloys owing to their pronounced plastic anisotropy. Conventional predictive methods such as the Coffin-Manson equation require manual parameter adjustment for different conditions, thus limiting their applicability. Accordingly, a novel predictive model for low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life that combines machine learning (ML) with an energy-based physical model, referred to as the hybrid ML/E model, is proposed herein. The hybrid ML/E model leverages a substantial hysteresis-loop dataset generated from LCF tests on a rolled AZ31 Mg alloy to effectively predict fatigue life. The proposed approach addresses the inherent challenges of small fatigue datasets, hysteresis-loop perception, and algorithm selection. The hybrid ML/E model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and robustness in various loading directions, based on validation against conventional methods. The integration of ML and physical principles offers a unified framework for the LCF life prediction of anisotropic materials and represents a significant advancement for industrial applications.},

This objective is not attainable through conventional machine learning (ML) approaches as well, such as artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The present study investigates the intricate nonlinear thermal history of Mg alloys induced by EPT to improve a predictive model under multipulse conditions. Furthermore, it enhances the predictivity and generalizability of a given problem using an ML model called i-LSTM by specifically tailoring a dataset. The i-LSTM model performance surpasses that of the constitutive approaches and conventional ML models when predicting the complicated thermal history of EPT specimens in a wide variety of processing parameters. The mechanisms underlying this improvement are discussed based on several experimental datasets. This study not only addresses challenges in existing models but also offers a promising avenue for understanding and predicting the thermal dynamics of Mg alloys subjected to the multipulse EPT process.},

   abstract = {Electropulsing treatment (EPT) has been developed as an alternative to furnace heat treatment (FHT) to exploit its engineering advantages in rapidly annealing metallic materials. Conventionally, the separation of thermal and athermal effects of EPT has been attempted by comparing EPT and FHT specimens processed under identical temperature and duration. However, this method inherently introduces experimental and measurement errors. This study proposes a novel approach to distinguish the thermal and athermal effects of EPT-processed metals using T-shaped specimen with two observation points, namely ‘C’ and ‘D’. For verification, the thermal gradient of T-shaped Mg alloys was examined under various EPT conditions. The points C exhibited higher temperatures compared to those at points D at a given electric current density, because only the former received both thermal and athermal effects. It was confirmed from twelve specimens that the point C at an electric current density of 65 A·mm−2 and point D at 70 A·mm−2 exhibited similar temperatures. This developed method is expected to reduce measurement errors in distinguishing thermal and athermal effects, thus providing a deeper understanding of their quantitative contributions in future studies.},

   abstract = {A post-heat treatment is necessary to finely adjust the desired microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti alloys produced by additive manufacturing. This research offers a comprehensive study of how electropulsing treatment (EPT) changes the microstructure and microhardness of Ti–6Al–4V alloy fabricated by selective laser melting. It verifies the potential benefits of using EPT instead of the conventional furnace heat treatment (FHT). The microstructural evolution was interpreted based on the number and magnitude of electropulses, which were then compared with FHT samples treated at the same temperatures and durations. Notably, the harmful columnar microstructure completely disappeared though the application of multiple electropulses at a current density of 20 A mm−2. Such a result was not attained by the FHT counterpart using the same peak temperature (1319 K) and duration (23 min). Furthermore, the EPT specimen exhibited a significant β-grain refinement. The accelerated atomic diffusion flux, one of athermal effects of EPT, resulted in the fast transformation of columnar microstructure into fine and equiaxed prior-β grains. The microhardness was affected by both lath thickness and phase constituents in the as-built alloy, whereas it was only governed by the former after the post-heat treatments. Utilizing EPT as an alternative post-heat treatment can effectively alleviate the microstructural inhomogeneity of additively manufactured metals.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the effects of electropulsing treatment (EPT) condition on the microstructure and microhardness of cold-rolled Grade 2 Ti sheet. Particular attention was paid to the dependence of the material properties on the electric current direction, referred to as electropulsing anisotropy. Direct-current (DC) EPT was applied along either the rolling direction (RD) or transverse direction (TD) of the rolled sheet. EPT along the TD resulted in a higher heating rate and maximum temperature, whereas that along the RD accelerated the static recrystallization (SRX) process under identical electropulsing parameters. Such a discrepancy was interpreted using the elongated grain structure and basal texture in the cold-rolled Ti sheet. These results were further supported by microhardness measurements, confirming the presence of electropulsing anisotropy during DC EPT in Ti alloys for the first time. In addition, the employed EPT was compared to a traditional furnace heat treatment (FHT) with rigorous temperature and time control, wherein the optimum EPT process spent only 13% of the processing time to complete SRX with a lower thermal energy requirement. This indicates a significant athermal contribution of EPT to electropulsing anisotropy.},

   pages = {1813-1823},
   abstract = {Because of their hexagonal close-packed structure, magnesium alloys exhibit anisotropy, leading to a lack of independent slip systems and thus inferior formability and mechanical properties at room temperature. Among the various methods used to address this issue, the weakening of the texture is effective, with particular attention paid to adjusting the stress direction based on the material texture to form deformation twins. This study investigated the effects of laser shock peening (LSP) as a practical alternative to traditional surface-hardening processes, focusing on the influencing role of the initial texture of AZ31 Mg alloys. Rolled alloys with a strong basal texture and extruded alloys with c-axes perpendicular to the extrusion direction showing basal fiber texture showed distinct differences in the types and fractions of deformation twins and Schmid behavior upon LSP application. Therefore, the type of twins activated depends on the orientation relationship between the loading direction and the c-axis, with the extruded alloy exhibiting greater activation of the {10–12} tension twins than the rolled alloy owing to the tensile stress states along the c-axis. Moreover, the variation in the behavior of the {10–12} tension twin formation in areas with different stresses resulted in one pair of twin variants in the rolled alloy and two in the extruded alloy. This study demonstrates the potential of LSP to control the texture of Mg alloys, with the initial texture essential in determining the direction of the process.},

   abstract = {Mg alloys possess an inherent plastic anisotropy owing to the selective activation of deformation mechanisms depending on the loading condition. This characteristic results in a diverse range of flow curves that vary with a deformation condition. This study proposes a novel approach for accurately predicting an anisotropic deformation behavior of wrought Mg alloys using machine learning (ML) with data augmentation. The developed model combines four key strategies from data science: learning the entire flow curves, generative adversarial networks (GAN), algorithm-driven hyperparameter tuning, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture. The proposed model, namely GAN-aided GRU, was extensively evaluated for various predictive scenarios, such as interpolation, extrapolation, and a limited dataset size. The model exhibited significant predictability and improved generalizability for estimating the anisotropic compressive behavior of ZK60 Mg alloys under 11 annealing conditions and for three loading directions. The GAN-aided GRU results were superior to those of previous ML models and constitutive equations. The superior performance was attributed to hyperparameter optimization, GAN-based data augmentation, and the inherent predictivity of the GRU for extrapolation. As a first attempt to employ ML techniques other than artificial neural networks, this study proposes a novel perspective on predicting the anisotropic deformation behaviors of wrought Mg alloys.},

   abstract = {Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy is an orthopedic implant material possessing good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. An international standard suggests a heat treatment known as &ldquo;capability aging&rdquo; for this alloy. This study provides extensive data of mechanical properties under a wide temperature condition built around the capability-aging process. Specifically, it investigates the effect of annealing temperature (573&ndash;973 K) on mechanical properties (i.e., yield strength, tensile strength, hardness, Young&rsquo;s modulus, and mechanical compatibility) of Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloys. Although these mechanical properties showed similar trends with respect to the annealing temperature, Young&rsquo;s modulus exhibited the highest value at 873 K in contrast to those of the other properties shown at 773 K. Such a disparity was discussed in light of static spheroidization and phase decomposition based on microstructural characteristics of the annealed Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloys.},

   abstract = {The importance of deformation twins in static recrystallization kinetics of high-purity alpha titanium was investigated by carrying out thermal annealing tests of deformed materials in combination with electron-backscatterdiffraction- based microstructural analysis. Prior to thermal annealing, the material was compressed to a true strain of 0.22 along three directions to introduce different twinning characteristics. Our results showed that deformation twins substantially promoted the static recrystallization process by deepening the microstructural inhomogeneity induced by the formation of twin boundaries and twinning-induced crystallographic lattice reorientation. Twin morphology was also observed to be important because it influenced the extent of microstructural inhomogeneity. Intersecting twin morphology, caused by the activation of multiple twin variants, was more effective than parallel twin morphology, caused by the activation of a single twin variant (or a twin variant pair), because it gave rise to more twin boundaries, more twin boundary junctions (intersections, triple junctions, etc.), and greater in-grain crystallographic orientation spread.},
