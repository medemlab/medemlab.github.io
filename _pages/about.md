The Metal Design & Mechanics (MEDEM) Lab is established in 2018 by Prof. Taekyung Lee of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Pusan National University, Korea.
MEDEM Lab specializes in research that combines microstructural characterization from materials science with fraction analysis from mechanical engineering, such as:
1. The dynamic fracture evaluation and mechanism investigation of metallic materials.
2. Improving the performance of metal products and weapons.
3. AI-aided optimization of metal-forming processes.
🚨 We are unable to hire non-Korean citizens due to the security requirements of our defense-related projects. We appreciate your understanding.

금속 설계 및 파괴역학 연구실(MEDEM)은 부산대학교 기계공학부 이태경 교수가 2018년에 설립한 연구실입니다. 우리는 재료과학의 미세조직 분석 기법과 기계공학의 물성 평가 기술을 결합하여 다음 연구를 수행합니다:
1. 금속재료의 동적파괴 평가 및 원리 규명 / Evaluation and Elucidation of Dynamic Metal Fracture
2. 금속제품 및 금속무기의 성능 향상 / Improvement of Mechanical Performance of Metallic Product
3. 인공지능 기반 금속 제조공정 최적화 / AI-Based Optimization of Metal-Forming Processes
